## Deployment

Arrow Functions: Utilized for concise function expressions, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

```bash
    const animalCategories = () => { /* ... */ };

```
const and let Declarations: Employed for block-scoped variable declarations, preventing issues related to variable hoisting and scope leakage.
```bash
    const displayCategories = (Categories) => { /* ... */ };
    let sortedPets = [];

```
Template Literals: Used for embedding expressions and creating multi-line strings, simplifying HTML generation within JavaScript.
```bash
  card.innerHTML = `
  <figure class="px-5 pt-5">
    <img src="${pet.image}" class="rounded-xl w-full h-full object-cover" alt="${pet.pet_name}" />
  </figure>
  <!-- ... -->
`;

```
Promises and async/await: Implemented for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from APIs, providing a cleaner and more readable asynchronous code structure.
```bash
  const animalDetails = async (Animal_Details) => { /* ... */ };

```
Destructuring Assignment: Applied to extract properties from objects and arrays, making data manipulation more straightforward.

```bash
  .then(data => displayCategories(data.categories))

```
